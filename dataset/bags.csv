<p>We spent 4 years redesigning the tripod from the ground up, creating a travel tripod that packs down to the diameter of a water bottle—without compromising height, stability, or features.</p>
<p>Traditional tripods have always suffered from needless bulk and wasted space, so we made it radically faster to setup and takedown. Our tripod features ergonomic adjustment points, built-in mobile compatibility, and thoughtful details at every turn. Plus, it’s built for life on the road: durable, 100% serviceable, and backed by the Peak Design lifetime guarantee.</p>
<p>Tripod includes legs, ballhead, protective soft case, ARCA-compatible Standard Plate, mobile mount, hex tool with carrying clip, and bushing removal tool for maintenance. See Specs section below for details.</p>

165,wireless-charging-stand,Wireless Charging Stand,"<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><meta charset=""utf-8""><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">Part desktop sculpture, part charging phone stand, our Wireless Charging Stand is made out of precision-machined anodized aluminum and adjusts with an ultra-smooth friction hinge to find your optimal viewing angle. Magnetically grabs your phone with a satisfying 'pop' and holds it in portrait or landscape mode. The magnets, charging components, and chassis are each custom-designed to optimize charging alignment, charging speed, and heat dissipation. This unique mounting system is called <b>SlimLink™</b>‚ and it's so fast and secure, it borders on magic. A grippy silicone base and solid aluminum build allows for 1-handed phone removal‚ the stand stays put, unlike with other magnetic chargers. Hinged construction lets you infinitely adjust viewing angle, and also fold the stand flat for easy transport. Elegant, functional, and beautiful, it's the charging stand that your desk or bedside table deserves. </span><br></p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">Ultralight and ultra-capable, the Peak Design Packable Tote is an unstructured and zippable carry-all. The Packable Tote offers key improvements over other packable tote bags: zip closure, a solo microfiber-padded shoulder/hand strap, and a self-healing nylon shell that is constructed out of a single piece of fabric, which minimizes seams and stress points. And it all packs down to become barely larger than a deck of cards.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The zip closure prevents spills and also keeps sand and dirt out, which greatly increases the versatility of the Packable Tote—groceries, travel, baby, beach—you’ll never stop finding uses for this bag. Lucky for you, it’s built to last. The durable #5 UltraZip can withstand decades of use, thanks to proprietary abrasion-resistant thread. The beautiful, 100% recycled ripstop 70D nylon/poly shell is self-healing, meaning it has a special coating that will actively heal small scratches. It’s also water-resistant. The shoulder strap is constructed from high-strength nylon webbing with a soft sewn-in microfiber pad. Unlike dual-strap totes, the single strap makes this bag easier to grab, carry, and stow. Weighs a svelte 80g (2.8oz) and packs down to slip inside any pocket or bag. The integrated stuff sack doubles as an interior pocket when using the tote.

200,vent-mount,Car Vent Mount,"<p>You get what you pay for with car vent mounts, and the Peak Design Car Vent Mount is hands-down the strongest, sturdiest, most adjustable vent mount money can buy. Traditional vent mounts are fraught with frustration: they're flimsy and prone to falling off, they're difficult to position, and they completely block airflow. Built from solid machined aluminum, the PD Car Vent Mount fastens to your vent with 2 points of connection for considerably more strength and stability. A 360-degree swivel arm lets you position your phone away from your vent for better airflow and easier viewing. And to top it off, this mount uses our SlimLink™ mounting system—powerful magnets and a UV-shielded anti-slip pad instantly grab hold of your phone in portrait or landscape. Adjust the viewing angle with a buttery-smooth aluminum ball head. This mount is strong enough for any kind of driving, off-road included.</p>

<p><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">Unlike traditional DSLR hand straps which press your palm against your camera body, Micro Clutch's padded Hypalon loop comfortably cradles 2-4 fingers.

<p><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">A beautiful low-profile machined aluminum baseplate conceals a hidden attachment tool, making battery access a breeze. Micro Clutch also includes a removable tripod plate for use with Capture V3, PD tripods, and 3rd party Arca-compatible tripods. A built-in Anchor attachment point allows use with any PD camera strap.</span></p>
