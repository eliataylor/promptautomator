Let's formulate 5 survey questions to gather information on a user's needs and preferences in bags:\n\n1. What is your primary use for a bag (e.g., casual outings, work, travel, sports)?\n2. What size of bag do you prefer (e.g., small crossbody, medium tote, large backpack)?\n3. Which material do you prefer for a bag (e.g., leather, canvas, nylon, etc.)?\n4. Do you prioritize organization features in a bag (e.g., multiple compartments, laptop sleeve, etc.)?\n5. Are there any specific colors or patterns you prefer for a bag?\n\nThese questions can help gauge the user's requirements and preferences in bags."}}
